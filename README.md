## Key Features
- **Data Sources**: The analysis uses a dataset with customer information, including demographics, services subscribed, and churn status.
- **Visualizations**: Offers various charts to showcase churn rates, customer segmentation, and trends by demographics.
- **Metrics**: Focuses on churn rate, retention rate, and customer lifetime value (CLV).
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides recommendations to improve customer retention strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used to create the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
- **Excel**: Employed for initial data cleaning and preparation.
- **Dataset**: Provided as an Excel file (`02 Churn-Dataset.xlsx`).

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Churn Status**: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
- **Demographics**: Information such as age, gender, income level, and location.
- **Services Subscribed**: Details about the services each customer uses (e.g., internet, phone).
- **Monthly Charges**: The monthly amount billed to the customer.
- **Tenure**: The length of time the customer has been with the company.

## Visualizations
Here are some of the key visualizations included in the dashboard:
- **Churn Rate by Demographics**: Bar charts showing the churn rate across different age groups, income levels, and regions.
- **Service Usage vs. Churn**: Visualizes the correlation between services subscribed and churn rates.
- **Monthly Charges vs. Tenure**: Scatter plot showing how billing amounts and customer tenure relate to churn.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Pie charts and bar graphs displaying customer demographics and retention patterns.

## Project Structure

## How to Use the Project
1. **Download the `.pbix` file** and open it in Power BI.
2. **View the Dashboard**: Explore interactive visualizations to gain insights into customer churn patterns.
3. **Adjust filters**: Use Power BI filters to examine different customer segments and factors affecting churn.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Target High-Risk Customers**: Customers with higher monthly charges or shorter tenures show a higher likelihood of churning. Consider offering them promotions or better service packages to retain them.
- **Demographic Patterns**: Certain age groups or regions are more prone to churn. Tailoring customer engagement strategies to these demographics may help reduce churn.
- **Service Optimization**: Services like internet and phone show higher churn rates. Consider improving service quality or revising pricing models for these products.
